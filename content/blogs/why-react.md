# Why I Chose React Over Other Frameworks

With so many frontend frameworks available today, here's why I still choose React.

## The Contenders

I've tried them all:
- **Vue** - Great developer experience
- **Svelte** - Innovative approach
- **Angular** - Enterprise-ready
- **React** - The ecosystem champion

## Why React Wins (For Me)

### 1. The Ecosystem

React's ecosystem is unmatched:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom  # Routing
npm install zustand           # State management
npm install react-query       # Data fetching
npm install framer-motion     # Animations
```

Whatever you need, there's a mature library for it.

### 2. Job Market

The reality is: **React skills are in high demand**.

Whether freelancing or looking for full-time work, React opens doors.

### 3. Learning Investment

I've spent years mastering React. That knowledge compounds:
- Hooks patterns
- Performance optimization
- Testing strategies

## When I'd Choose Something Else

React isn't always the answer:

| Use Case | My Pick |
|----------|---------|
| Simple landing page | Plain HTML/CSS |
| Content-heavy site | Astro or Next.js |
| Quick prototype | Svelte |

## Conclusion

There's no "best" framework. Pick one, master it, and build things.

For me, that's React. What's yours?
