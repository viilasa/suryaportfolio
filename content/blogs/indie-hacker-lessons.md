# 5 Lessons from My First Year as an Indie Hacker

After a year of building products independently, here are the most valuable lessons I've learned.

## 1. Ideas Are Cheap, Execution Is Everything

Everyone has ideas. The difference between dreamers and builders is **execution**.

I used to spend weeks perfecting ideas in my head. Now I validate them in days.

## 2. Revenue > Users

Early on, I was obsessed with user counts. But users who don't pay are just numbers.

> "If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late." - Reid Hoffman

## 3. Distribution Beats Product

You can have the best product in the world, but if no one knows about it, you have nothing.

I now spend 50% of my time on marketing:
- Building in public on Twitter
- Writing blog posts
- Engaging with communities

## 4. Consistency Compounds

The indie hackers who succeed aren't necessarily the smartest. They're the ones who **show up every day**.

Small daily progress leads to massive results over time.

## 5. Health First

Burnout is real. I learned this the hard way.

Now I prioritize:
- 8 hours of sleep
- Regular exercise
- Taking breaks

Your business can't succeed if you can't.
