# Building ProofEdge: From Idea to Product

The journey started with a simple observation: **every successful website uses social proof**, but setting it up is unnecessarily complicated.

## The Problem

I noticed that most social proof solutions were either:
- Too expensive for indie hackers
- Too complex to integrate
- Looking outdated and spammy

## The Solution

ProofEdge was born out of this frustration. I wanted to create something that was:

1. **Simple to integrate** - Just one line of code
2. **Beautiful by default** - No ugly popups
3. **Affordable** - Pricing that makes sense for small businesses

## Tech Stack

Here's what I used to build ProofEdge:

```javascript
const techStack = {
  frontend: ['React', 'Vite', 'TailwindCSS'],
  backend: ['Node.js', 'Express'],
  database: ['PostgreSQL'],
  hosting: ['Vercel', 'Railway']
};
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Ship Fast, Iterate Faster

The biggest lesson was to get something in front of users as quickly as possible. My first version was embarrassingly simple, but it validated the idea.

### 2. Talk to Users

Every feature in ProofEdge came from user feedback. I didn't assume what people wanted - I asked them.

### 3. Focus on One Thing

Instead of building 10 mediocre features, I focused on making one thing exceptional: **the notification widget**.

## What's Next

I'm currently focused on:
- Building more integrations
- Improving the analytics dashboard
- Growing the user base

If you're building something yourself, remember: **the best time to start is now**.
