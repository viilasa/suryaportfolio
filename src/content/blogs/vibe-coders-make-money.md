Everyone's building. Nobody's selling.

That's the uncomfortable reality hiding inside every "I shipped my app in a weekend!" tweet you've ever liked.

The vibe coding wave promised something intoxicating: an era where *anyone* could build a product. No CS degree. No 10,000 hours of grinding LeetCode. Just you, your ideas, and an AI that turns English into working software.

The promise delivered.

Building is now trivially easy.

And that's exactly the problem.

## The Illusion That's Keeping You Broke

Here's what most people believe when they start vibe coding:

*"If I can just build the thing, the money will follow."*

It won't.

I asked a room full of vibe coders on Reddit: who's actually making money? The answers were revealing — not because of who said yes, but because of *why* the ones making money were succeeding.

Almost none of them were succeeding because they built something good.

They were succeeding because they understood something most builders refuse to accept:

**The product was never the hard part.**

A developer with 10+ years of experience who switched to vibe coding put it plainly. He's clearing $30k per quarter — not by launching a SaaS, not by going viral, but by showing up with skills, finding clients, and solving problems that were already real. The AI just made him faster.

Another person rebuilt their entire company's software stack from scratch with vibe coding. Better, faster, more stable than the version built by a team of 3-4 developers. Did it increase sales? No. Did it cut costs and increase margins? Significantly.

Notice what both of these people have in common.

They brought something *before* the code.

## The Truth About the "Vibe Coding Gold Rush"

The internet loves a gold rush narrative.

Vibe coding is the latest one. Before it was no-code. Before that was dropshipping. Before that was blogging.

And every single time, the pattern is the same:

The tools get democratized. The barrier to entry drops to zero. Thousands of people flood in thinking the tool *is* the opportunity. And most of them leave with nothing.

Because they confused the pick with the gold.

Here's what nobody is saying out loud:

**When everyone can build, building becomes worthless.**

The vibe coding market is flooded. Commenters in the thread said it directly — "everyone and their mom is doing it." If you can vibe code a productivity app, so can your potential customer. They might just build it themselves instead of buying yours.

The only thing that creates leverage in a world of infinite builders is distribution.

Audience. Trust. Reach. Relationships.

The skills nobody wants to develop because they feel slower and less exciting than shipping features.

## What the People Making Money Actually Did

Let's be specific. Because vague advice is just motivation porn.

**They went niche to the point of discomfort.**

The people reporting real revenue weren't building "AI writing tools" or "productivity apps." They were building keyboard switch testing tools, self-storage management software, AI assistants specifically for Apple Watch, niche trading automation for their own workflow.

The narrower the target, the less competition. The less competition, the easier the sale.

Most vibe coders build for "everyone."

Everyone is no one.

**They already had something to sell before they had something to build.**

An ex-brand advisor with an existing audience. A freelance developer with existing clients. A business owner using the tools to improve margins they already had. A trader building for their own workflow they already understood deeply.

The product didn't create the opportunity. The opportunity already existed. The product was just the vehicle.

**They treated distribution like a first-class problem.**

One person explicitly used SEO from day one. Another leveraged a social media following they'd built over years. One won hackathons — not just for the prize money, but for the visibility and consulting work it opened up.

They understood something the builders don't:

*A product nobody knows about doesn't exist.*

## The Uncomfortable Math of Vibe Coding

Here's a thought experiment nobody wants to sit with.

You spend a weekend vibe coding an app. Let's say it takes you 10 hours of prompting and testing. The AI tokens cost you $20. You launch it.

It makes $0.

Did vibe coding save you money?

No. It cost you a weekend, $20, and — more importantly — the *belief* that building the thing was all you needed to do.

The most dangerous outcome of the vibe coding movement isn't that people build bad products.

It's that people build decent products, watch them sit at zero, and conclude that the market doesn't want what they're selling.

When actually — the market never knew it existed.

## The Real Opportunity Nobody's Talking About

Here's the reframe.

Stop thinking about vibe coding as a way to build products to sell.

Start thinking about it as a force multiplier for skills you already have.

The developer who makes $30k/quarter isn't selling "vibe coding." He's selling websites and automations, faster than ever before because AI handles the tedious parts.

The product manager who rebuilt company software isn't selling a SaaS. He's making himself irreplaceable inside an existing business.

The trader who built his own prediction model isn't a startup founder. He's a trader who now has an unfair advantage.

Each of them used vibe coding the same way a surgeon uses a better scalpel.

The scalpel doesn't make you a surgeon. But if you're already a surgeon, a better scalpel changes everything.

## What To Do Instead

If you want to actually make money as a vibe coder, here's the honest path:

**Build for problems you already live inside.** The best products come from builders who are also the customer. If you don't deeply understand the pain, you'll build the wrong solution.

**Solve distribution before you solve features.** Before you write a single line of code, ask: how will people find this? If the answer is "I'll figure it out later," that's your problem.

**Use vibe coding to compound existing skills.** Don't try to start from zero with vibe coding as your only asset. Bring domain knowledge, industry relationships, or an audience. The coding is the last piece, not the first.

**Think services before products.** Services have a shorter path to revenue. You find one client, solve one problem, get paid. Then you build the product that solves it for a hundred clients at once. Most people try to skip the first step.

## The Bottom Line

Vibe coding is real. The productivity gains are real. The lowered barrier to entry is real.

But the money isn't in the building.

It never was.

The money is in the selling. The trust. The distribution. The niche you own so deeply that when someone has the problem, they think of you first.

The builders who are making money understand this.

They're not shipping features.

They're compounding advantages.

And that's a skill you can start developing today — whether or not you ever write a single prompt.

*The bottleneck has always been distribution. Vibe coding just made that fact impossible to ignore.*
