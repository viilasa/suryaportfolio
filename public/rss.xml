# Your Website Is Lying to Every Visitor Who Lands on It

Most websites are graveyards.

People show up, look around for 8 seconds, and leave — never to return.

You've spent money on ads. You've obsessed over your headline. You've A/B tested your CTA button color three times this month.

And still, nothing.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **your visitors don't trust you.**

Not because your product is bad. Not because your copy isn't sharp enough. But because human beings are wired — at a neu...]]></content:encoded>

# You're Not Early. You're Just Hiding.

*"I'm still early."*

That sentence sounds harmless.

Even smart.

Founders say it with confidence—like they're playing the long game.

But look closer.

Six months in. A finished product. A clean UI. A working checkout.

**And zero users.**

That's not early.

**That's avoidance.**

## The Comfortable Lie

"Early" feels responsible. Patient. Strategic.

It sounds better than the truth.

Because the truth is uncomfortabl...]]></content:encoded>

## The Real Pain of SaaS Feature Bloat

I didn’t hate SaaS tools because they were *bad*.

I hated them because they **stole my time**.

Not in small bites. Not in “oops I clicked something.” But in big, silent drains caused by **feature bloat**.

I paid for “premium.” Upgraded. Subscribed. Committed.

I got:

- Fancy templates
- Hundreds of widgets
- Animations that look cool on sales pages

But when it came down to *actually using it*?

I used none of them.

# Building ProofEdge: From Idea to Product

The journey started with a simple observation: **every successful website uses social proof**, but setting it up is unnecessarily complicated.

## The Problem

I noticed that most social proof solutions were either:
- Too expensive for indie hackers
- Too complex to integrate
- Looking outdated and spammy

## The Solution

ProofEdge was born out of this frustration. I wanted to create something that was:

# 5 Lessons from My First Year as an Indie Hacker

After a year of building products independently, here are the most valuable lessons I've learned.

## 1. Ideas Are Cheap, Execution Is Everything

Everyone has ideas. The difference between dreamers and builders is **execution**.

I used to spend weeks perfecting ideas in my head. Now I validate them in days.

## 2. Revenue > Users

Early on, I was obsessed with user counts. But users who don't pay are just numbers.

# Why I Chose React Over Other Frameworks

With so many frontend frameworks available today, here's why I still choose React.

## The Contenders

I've tried them all:
- **Vue** - Great developer experience
- **Svelte** - Innovative approach
- **Angular** - Enterprise-ready
- **React** - The ecosystem champion

## Why React Wins (For Me)

### 1. The Ecosystem

React's ecosystem is unmatched:

npm install react-router-dom  # Routing
