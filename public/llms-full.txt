## Identity

Surya Narayan is an indie hacker and full-stack developer from India who builds SaaS products that solve real problems. He follows an execution-first philosophy: learn fast, implement faster, fail without ego, and use AI as leverage. He is currently building ProofEdge (social proof SaaS) and NovaNews (AI news aggregator).

### Operating Principles
1. **Learn fast, implement faster** — Technology and startups are best learned while implementing, not by memorizing theory. Copy, Modify, Master.
2. **Fail without ego** — Most products become useful by the third failure. Understanding trade-offs well enough to deliver real value.
3. **AI as leverage** — Using AI to learn faster, ship sooner, and reduce friction. It doesn't replace thinking; it multiplies execution.

### Philosophy
- **Execution**: Learn fast. Ship faster. Build in public to attract the right people.
- **Tools**: If you don't use AI, someone else will.
- **Success**: Money is a tool for freedom. Work-life balance creates better work long-term.
- **Clients**: Seeking international, ecommerce-focused value seekers.

### Timeline
- **May–Aug 2023**: React + SaaS Thinking — Moving beyond static websites
- **Sept–Nov 2023**: AI Tools & Vibecoding — Adapting to the AI explosion
- **2024**: Reality & Iteration — Built, failed, paused. Shipping imperfectly beats shipping late.
- **2025**: Clients, Sales & Products — Business thinking catching up with technical execution

### Currently Learning
- Medusa JS, E-commerce Systems, Sales & Marketing, Business Fundamentals, Personal Growth

### Goals
- **Next 6 months**: Establish public presence as a builder who ships. Focus on product-led growth.
- **Next 1-2 years**: One product reaching acquisition-level maturity. Positioning alongside serious builders and investors.

### Article: Your Website Is Lying to Every Visitor Who Lands on It

Most websites are graveyards. People show up, look around for 8 seconds, and leave. The uncomfortable truth: your visitors don't trust you — not because your product is bad, but because human beings are wired to look at what other people are doing before they act. This is social proof — the psychological phenomenon where people assume the actions of others reflect the correct behavior.

Key concepts:
- Social proof creates "cognitive ease" — the feeling that something is familiar, safe, and verified by others.
- The 5 types that work: Recent Activity Notifications, Live Visitor Counts, Purchase & Signup Streams, Review Aggregations, Countdown + Scarcity Triggers.
- Social proof is not a section at the bottom of the page. It's a layer woven into the experience from the first second to the last click.
- ProofEdge (proofedge.io) provides real-time social proof widgets — purchases, sign-ups, live visitors, reviews — as clean, customizable overlays.
- Social proof compounds: more trust → more conversions → more social proof → more trust. The flywheel is self-reinforcing.

Quotable: "Social proof isn't a tactic. It's the oldest conversion mechanism in human history. Your website either speaks that language — or it doesn't."

### Article: You're Not Early. You're Just Hiding.

Most founders aren't early — they're scared. "I'm still early" sounds harmless, even smart. But six months in with a finished product, clean UI, working checkout, and zero users — that's not early, that's avoidance.

Key arguments:
- "Early" becomes a permission slip to stay invisible. No rejection, no awkward conversations, no one questioning your idea.
- Momentum doesn't die loudly. It dies quietly while you polish features no one asked for.
- Founders aren't afraid of "no" — they're afraid of indifference and silence.
- You don't find product-market fit by hiding from the market. You find it by being wrong in public.
- Confidence is a side effect of exposure, not a prerequisite for action.
- Building feels safe because code doesn't judge you. People do.
- The shift: talk before you build more, sell before you feel confident, explain the problem before claiming a solution.

Quotable: "If I haven't spoken to users this week, I'm not allowed to build. One real conversation beats a month of silent shipping."

### Article: Your SaaS Is Bloated Because You're Afraid to Say No

Feature bloat kills SaaS products. The best products are defined by what they don't do. Saying no is the most important skill for SaaS founders.

The journey of building ProofEdge, a social proof SaaS. Problem: existing solutions were too expensive, too complex, or too ugly.

Tech stack: React, Vite, TailwindCSS (frontend), Node.js, Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database), Vercel and Railway (hosting). Lessons: ship fast and iterate, talk to users, focus on one thing.

Five lessons: (1) Ideas are cheap, execution is everything. (2) Revenue matters more than user counts. (3) Distribution beats product — spend 50% of time on marketing. (4) Consistency compounds — show up every day. (5) Health first — burnout is real.

### Article: Why I Chose React Over Other Frameworks

Comparison of React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular. React wins for: unmatched ecosystem, high job market demand, compounding learning investment. When to choose alternatives: plain HTML for landing pages, Astro/Next.js for content-heavy sites, Svelte for quick prototypes.
